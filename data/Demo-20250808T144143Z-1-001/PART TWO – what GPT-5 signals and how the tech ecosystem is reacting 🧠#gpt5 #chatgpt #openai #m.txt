So all in all, is it better than GPT-4? Yes, on accuracy, on hallucinations. Do I see it as a crazy milestone towards AGI? I don't know yet. At the same time, it's worth remembering that OpenAI has an insane consumer market position here. Chattity now has 700 million weekly active users, which is up 4x in the last year. Google's Gemini trails that, but only at 450 monthly active users. And it's clear that OpenAI is coming for the enterprise too by positioning GPT-5, coding, and pitching a very strategic pricing. With the low cost, they're basically pressuring anthropic or Google to match for risk-losing developer adoption. And finally, at a super high level, one of the more interesting takeaways from Sam Altman's remarks today is that he's very much so still a firm believer in scaling laws. A lot of people argue that we're hitting a ceiling with LLMs. He believes that there are still three levers for major gains, more compute, higher quality data, and better training environments, meaning that we might see the current transformer paradigm, power GPT-6, GPT-7, all without needing any brand new architecture. Of course, he also admits that this will come with eye-watering level compute investments. So to wrap, GPT-5 is faster, it's smarter, and it's more accessible, but still not AGI. So we'll see how this all plays out.
