Neuralink is now quietly working on a smart, bionic eye. The brain computer and face company founded by Elon Musk has quietly joined the clinical trial aimed at building it, and if successful, it could help people who are blind, recognize faces, read, navigate the world using an AI-powered brain implant. The goal of this technology is to bypass damaged eyes altogether, and instead of relying on the retina or your eye itself, the system would implant ultra thin electrode arrays directly into the brain's visual cortex, which is the part of the brain responsible for processing site. It essentially uses brain simulation to recreate the experience of site. The Spionic Eye Project also complements Neuralink's blind site device, which must claim to normally be able to restore vision, but also potentially enable superhuman site, including the ability to perceive wavelengths that are totally invisible to the human eye, like infrared, ultraviolet, or even radar signals. However, it is worth noting that blind site has only been tested in monkeys and not yet in humans, and that a lot of researchers believe that superhuman vision remains largely speculative. With all of this, Neuralink is on a pretty aggressive timeline. There are a means to launch human trials for blind site by 2026, and scaled to 20,000 surgeries annually by 2031, with a projected revenue of a billion dollars a year from its implant portfolio. And if all of this works out, it would mean that Neuralink would be able to not only impact movement, but also restore sensory perception with its devices too.
