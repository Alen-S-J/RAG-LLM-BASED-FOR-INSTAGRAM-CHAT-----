3 bars in Bombay that are an absolute must visit. I think my first trick would be America look. Everything about the place, the vibe, the crowd, the way you stand, the way you sit, the cocktails, the food, all of it adds up to giving you a very European vibe. You go for the cocktails, but to stay for the theta machine. My recommendation would be Bandra Bond. If you're visiting Bombay for the culture and the food, this is a must visit. They brought traditional dishes of Mumbai to life and the cocktails are smashing. And once again, you go for the cocktails and you stay for the caribbean guns. Oh yes, it's one of the best caribbean guns I've had. There are so many cases in Mumbai that it's hard to pick one, but the one that I would recommend is paradox. The vibe of it is almost like a speakeasy in terms of its headache. It's a bar where you go in a small group like when a couple of friends or like on a date or like with just one or two people and you stay there either until the storage in your cool runs out or the money that you're paying for the cocktails runs out.
