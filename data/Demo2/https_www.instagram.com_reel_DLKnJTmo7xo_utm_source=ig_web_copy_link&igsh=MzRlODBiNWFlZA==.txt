Things you should never say on a dating app after 30. Looking for vibes. What vibe are you looking for? Is it love? Is it trauma bonding? Is it a rebound after your last break up? Another one is... Hey you up dude, look at the time. It's 10 a.m. in the morning. I am up and I'm done with this chat also. I'm not looking for anything serious. This is a dating app. If you're not looking for anything serious, go start a podcast. Wait a minute. Just here for fun. That includes emotional safety. Deep sleep, running in the morning and 100 different things. See you got to specify. Let's see where this goes. We're not here on a track. Either you'll be intentional or be invisible. Someone who says, if you can't handle me at my worst, maybe you're not looking to date. You're looking for someone who will sign up for your disaster insurance.
