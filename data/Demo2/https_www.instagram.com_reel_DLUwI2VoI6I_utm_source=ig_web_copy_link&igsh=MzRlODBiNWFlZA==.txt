What are some fitness and wellness habits that you would want to see in your partner in their 30s? The fact that they prioritize sleep, it's only your 30s probably that you realize that sleep is not a luxury, it is the foundation, it's like a necessity. They like to walk a lot to the grocery store, at the airport, when you're traveling, they walk a lot. They say no to plans that disrupt their fitness and wellness routines, whether that is cutting back on alcohol, whether that is not going out socially to the extent that you just lose track of what the next is going to look like. They're chasing overall well-being and not just aesthetics, because in your 30s you've got to take care of your whole body and your mental health. That includes strength, that includes agility, that includes movement, everything.
