What are some signs that show that you're not lonely? You're just tired of shallow conversations. I was so many. I'm personally tired of questions like, Hey, how's work? Long time. Let's catch up soon. I would rather have them ask me, Are you doing okay? Are you surviving? Just functioning or your beak actually has... Like, what's good? Yeah. What have you been looking for? Yeah. Also, not having a hundred people around, but maybe just two or three who really get you. You've been to enough parties. You've had many shallow conversations. Now, you don't want to have conversations that will leave you empty or then before. What are the signs that also your craving presence not necessarily proximity? Presence of someone, of a friend or just anybody. And you need somebody who listens to you and not just replies. I think it's not loneliness. It's the emotional hundred. And most people are talking with some sort of a filter on it. Never a human connection that they're long here.
