00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:09,001
Now is the time to visit
Spain's capital. After nearly a

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,161
decade of economic crisis,
Madrid is growing again. And

3
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:16,281
you can feel this confidence in
the central district of

4
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:20,601
Hosticia. Its streets team with
restaurants and boutique shops

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:25,001
supplying cakes, coffee and
cocktails to trendy locals and

6
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:31,001
visitors alike. Welcome to
Hosticia, Madrid.

7
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:38,821
Tucked just north of Madrid
city centre is Husticia. In

8
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,261
just a few years this area has
evolved into one of the city's

9
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,541
trendiest districts.

10
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,381
Spain is only recently
recovered from a long and

11
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:54,741
painful recession which gripped
the country from 2008 to 2014.

12
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:59,621
At its height, unemployment was
above 26% while youth

13
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:05,841
unemployment was above
55percent. Spain's economy is

14
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:09,521
now growing and the effect of
this hardship in Housticia has

15
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:12,961
not been the mass closure of
independent stores but instead

16
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:19,281
a flight to buy and support
local business. This is Do

17
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:23,121
Design, a store which captures
that spirit of creativity and

18
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:27,121
community. The shop
collaborates with emerging

19
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,161
artists and designers
constantly shifting its

20
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:33,921
collection. Here you'll find
fashion, interior and jewelry

21
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:40,601
brands you've never heard of
before. Surviving Spain's

22
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,961
recession has forced businesses
to think differently. This is

23
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:48,441
and the first thing you'll
notice is all the bottles of

24
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:53,001
liquor are their own
handwritten brands. During the

25
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:57,161
recession cocktails one thing
people cut down on. The owners

26
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:01,001
of Mathera had an idea. They
bought unbranded liquor and

27
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,601
infused it themselves making
every cocktails seven euros.

28
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,881
It's now one of Madrid's
coolest bars but some very

29
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:11,381
exciting flavours think rum
infused with cinnamon and

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:16,021
orange and gin with rosemary
and thyme.

31
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,341
One Spanish tradition that has
shown no signs of being under

32
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:28,981
threat despite recent trends is
churros deep fried sugar coated

33
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:32,501
