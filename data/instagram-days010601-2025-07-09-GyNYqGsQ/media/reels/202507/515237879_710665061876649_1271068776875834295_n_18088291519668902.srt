1
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:05,701
Miami, the name brings to mind
gorgeous beaches, warm weather,

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,921
and art deco landmarks. But at
the intersection of North and

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,641
South America, Miami has
exploded on to the

4
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:17,401
international cultural scene in
recent decades. Want to

5
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:20,281
experience the best of Miami?
Venture beyond Glitzy South

6
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:26,481
Beach and swing by these three
hot spots on the mainland. The

7
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,321
first stop is Coconut Grove.
Situated southwest of downtown

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,161
Miami, this upscale residential
enclave is one of Miami's

9
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:38,241
oldest and most iconic
neighborhoods. The gem of

10
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:42,561
Coconut Grove is Vizcaya Museum
and Gardens. Originally built

11
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,001
as a winter home by business
magnate James Deeren. The

12
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,761
Vizcaya Estate is nestled among
dense mangrove swamps and

13
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:56,141
offers a spectacular view of
Biscayne Bay. Your Nate Maine

14
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,101
House features a blend of
Italian renaissance revival and

15
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,381
broke architecture and inside
you'll find an exquisite

16
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,021
collection of art and
furnishings acquired by Deering

17
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:10,661
during his world travels. The
lush, expensive gardens

18
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,141
surrounding the main compound
are a welcome break from

19
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,261
Miami's hot sun and a prime
backdrop for your Instagram

20
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:24,961
feed. You. If you've built up
an appetite, head north and

21
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,601
you'll eventually reach
Southwest eighth Street better

22
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:32,661
known as Cale Ocho, the main
thoroughfare of Little Havana.

23
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:35,541
Even though Americans can now
fly to the real Havana in less

24
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,301
than an hour, Little Havana
remains an enthralling outpost

25
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,181
for the Cuban expatriot
community and a vibrant setting

26
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:47,361
for Cuban food, culture, and
ambiance. Drop by the walk-up

27
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:50,801
window at the legendary cafe
Versailles for a croquette or a

28
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:55,841
Cortarito, a supercharged Cuban
version of espresso. Day or

29
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,801
night you're bound to encounter
old friends catching up or a

30
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,561
heated debate about politics.

31
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,941
Right across the street is La
Carreta which serves a variety

32
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:10,941
of authentic Cuban specialties
including Ropa Vieja and rice

33
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:14,541
with sweet plantains. If you're
feeling lucky after lunch,

34
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,381
settle in for a street siding
of dominoes if you can find a

35
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:24,881
sea fittings. As evening
approaches, the energy and buzz

36
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,361
shifts to a bustling
art-infused area north of

37
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,961
downtown called Wynwood. No
other neighborhood in Miami has

38
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,921
undergone as dramatic a
transformation as this former

39
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,961
industrial district that has
been reborn as a hub for

40
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,001
international art galleries,
shops, and a diverse restaurant

41
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:44,641
scene. The year-round pleasant
weather and seemingly endless

42
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:48,001
collection of vibrant street
murals has made Wynwood into a

43
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:53,141
giant outdoor art gallery. For
a unique dinner option, drop by

44
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:56,421
1800 Lucky, an open food hall
in the style of an Asian

45
00:02:56,421 --> 00:03:00,261
market. Featuring a collection
of vendors offering a variety

46
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:04,741
of dishes from fresh ramen to
steamed dim sum to hot baking

47
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:11,901
duck. Finish off the night with
matcha ice cream served in a

48
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,101
fish-shaped cone or an
Asian-inspired cocktail at the

49
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,801
bar. Looking around, it's hard
to believe that you're still in

50
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:23,801
Miami but when it's 80 degrees
in the middle of winter, you'll

51
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,761
be glad you are.
