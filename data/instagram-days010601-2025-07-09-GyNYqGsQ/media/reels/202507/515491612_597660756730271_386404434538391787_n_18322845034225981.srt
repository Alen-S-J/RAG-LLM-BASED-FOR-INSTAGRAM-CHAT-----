1
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:08,261
If you think of Macau, you
probably think about gambling

2
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:13,061
and for good reason. It's the
world's largest gambling hub.

3
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:17,141
The region generates four times
more gaming revenue than Las

4
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,581
Vegas. Making it one of the
richest places in the world.

5
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,501
But there's more to Macau than
slot machines and roulette

6
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:28,581
wheels. For over 400 years it
was a Portuguese colony.

7
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:32,621
Ancient Chinese temples sit on
streets paved with traditional

8
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:38,641
Portuguese tiles. Welcome to
car.

9
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:48,881
Macau is only a one hour ferry
ride from Hong Kong and is a

10
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:53,441
gambling Mecca. In 2 thousand
and 17, mainland Chinese

11
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:59,361
tourists made over 22 million
trips to Macau and spent $273

12
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:05,201
per person. There are 41
casinos in the region and the

13
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:11,041
gambling industry makes up 60%
of GDP. But there's more to

14
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,681
this city. You don't have to
spend your time throwing money

15
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:17,761
away in air conditioned rooms.

16
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:24,501
This is Macau Peninsula, a
large section of which is a

17
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,581
designated UNESCO world
heritage site. Here the blend

18
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:32,021
of Portuguese and Chinese
culture is plain to see.

19
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:36,701
Churches sit alongside temples
of fortresses bear a mix of

20
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:42,121
characteristics. These are the
ruins of Saint Paul's probably

21
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,361
the most well known landmark in
Macau. It was originally a 17th

22
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,961
century church and college but
was destroyed by fire in the

23
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:54,041
19th century. It features
baroque carvings of oriental

24
00:01:54,041 --> 00:02:00,361
themes. The blend of cultures
has also shaped the food scene.

25
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:04,121
Street vendors will sell you
Portuguese custard tarts and

26
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:10,301
pork chop bun to Macau version
of a hamburger. At the other

27
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:14,461
end of the spectrum is Alocha.
This authentic Portuguese

28
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:17,661
restaurant keeps the colonial
culinary history of Macau

29
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:22,141
alive. Its interior design is a
nod to the area's naval

30
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,701
history.

31
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,181
Finally, check out the view
from the Macau Tower and then

32
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:34,581
leap off it. You can bungee
down from the platform 233

33
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:39,541
meters above the ground, sure
beats walking.
