1
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:06,521
If you've traveled to Hong
Kong, chances are you've stayed

2
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:11,001
or worked here. Amongst the
skyscrapers of Hong Kong

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:15,081
Island. But Hong Kong Island is
running out of room to expand.

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:19,321
Housing is the least affordable
anywhere in the world and you

5
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,841
don't get much for your money.
The average size flat is

6
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:26,201
smaller than what you'd get in
Manhattan. And many Hong Kong

7
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:31,381
is live in apartments not much
bigger than a garage. It's

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,661
because of this pressure that
the next time you visit, you're

9
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,421
more likely to stay here.
Across Victoria Harbour in Siem

10
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,301
Satsoi.

11
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:52,021
Is not easy to say and it's
often mispronounced. So it's

12
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,061
known to expats as TST. Today
the area is a growing

13
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,261
metropolis packed with a huge
variety of restaurants, modern

14
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:05,221
hotels and sleek museums. So
it's hard to believe it once

15
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,941
looked like this. During the
1880s it was a watch post for

16
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:12,901
the British colony and some of
the grand old buildings still

17
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:18,241
remain. This is the eighty 81
Heritage Building which used to

18
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:22,481
be the headquarters of the
Marine Police. Now it's filled

19
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:26,081
with high end shopping, a
hotel, restaurants and bars but

20
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:31,441
most people come here to take
photos. Walk down the road a

21
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:33,841
couple of blocks and you'll
come to Hong Kong's iconic

22
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:38,641
Peninsula Hotel. Built in 1928,
it is made appearances in films

23
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,481
like James Bond and the Dark
Knight. It's known for its

24
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,921
fleet of Rolls Royce phantoms
painted in the hotels signature

25
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:52,161
green which it holds the record
for the largest single order.

26
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:59,741
Running through the centre of
TST is Nathan Road. What

27
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:04,701
started as a muddy country path
built by the British in 1861 is

28
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:09,921
now a shopper's paradise.
Nathan Road is probably best

29
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,761
known for its tailors and the
tradition of tempting or

30
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:18,881
twisting the arms of tourists
walking by. Handmade suits

31
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:23,281
start at around $300 but for
higher quality threads go to

32
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:27,601
Empire International tailors.
This unassuming store is in

33
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,801
fact the base of a global
operation. This family run

34
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:34,481
business sells suits around the
world mostly thanks to word of

35
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:40,281
mouth. Now you're dressed for
dinner, head to the top of one

36
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:44,761
peaking road tower. This gem of
a Chinese restaurant is made to

37
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:50,361
look like a Hong or old Chinese
alley. Go up two floors and

38
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:54,521
you'll find AquaSpirit, one of
Hong Kong's premium bars. It

39
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:59,701
has some of the best views of
the city. And when you get

40
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:03,941
tired of the hustle and bustle
of walk over to one of Hong

41
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:10,201
Kong's most famous institutions
the Star Ferry. Running since

42
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:14,361
1888, this is the oldest mode
of transportation across the

43
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,681
harbour and you can hop on for
just 30 cents and enjoy one of

44
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:22,761
the world's most photographed
harbours.
