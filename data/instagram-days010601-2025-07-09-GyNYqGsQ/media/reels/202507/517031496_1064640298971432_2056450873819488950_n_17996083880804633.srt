00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:07,421
San Francisco looks and feels
like a big city but it's

2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:12,481
actually quite small. It has a
population of under a million

3
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:17,761
and is only 47 square miles.
But what it lacks in size, it

4
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:22,981
makes up for in price San
Francisco is amongst America's

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,861
most expensive cities. The
soaring cost of living and the

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,981
injection of Silicon Valley
money has led some people to

7
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:35,461
claim that towns lost its soul
but have no fear there's still

8
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:42,261
plenty of mojo left by the bay.
Welcome to San Francisco.

9
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:50,761
San Francisco is the cultural,
commercial, and financial

10
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:56,741
center of Northern California.
This city's reputation is built

11
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:00,501
on its colourful history. It
hosted the beat generation and

12
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:04,101
the free love movement of the
60s and 70s and was the

13
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:09,621
birthplace of pride. But these
days the Bohemian dream is up

14
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:13,301
against it. The average rent
for a one bedroom apartment is

15
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:18,661
over $3, 000. Nearly four times
the US national average. So

16
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,941
when checking out the city
start by dodging the traffic

17
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:27,661
and embracing your inner flower
power by grabbing a bike.

18
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:31,901
Although San Francisco's fame
for its steep hills, many parts

19
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,061
of the city are actually
relatively flat.

20
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:43,461
Start your journey at Pier 39
and pay a visit to the seals.

21
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:47,781
These guys turned up after the
earthquake of 198nine and

22
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:51,221
they've stayed ever since.

23
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:56,841
A 10 minute ride away is
Chinatown. This is the oldest

24
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:01,481
and second largest Chinatown in
North America. And despite all

25
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:07,301
the city's rapid changes, it
remains unbowed. House of

26
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,661
Nanking is famous for its
delicious cuisine and direct

27
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:14,741
service that some people might
find a bit rude but don't take

28
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:18,981
it personally, it's all part of
the experience.

29
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:25,181
Another quick ride will get you
from Chinatown to south of

30
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:29,261
market or Soma. This vast
warehouse filled district is

31
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:35,921
home to countless live work
spaces. Red Door Coffee inside

32
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:39,681
the 111 Meena Art Gallery is
the perfect place to chill for

33
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:45,401
a moment before heading into
the heart of the mission. For

34
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:48,281
decades, the mission was a
middle-class immigrant enclave

35
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:51,321
but it was steadily gentrified
by hipsters starting in the

36
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:56,361
nineties. Here you'll find some
of the world's best burritos

37
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:02,201
served up mission style.
Taqueria El Castillo is one of

38
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,761
the best. Don't let their lack
of decor ward you off. This is

39
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,721
the real deal.

40
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:15,001
Now you're fueled up. It's time
to tackle the hills. Riding up

41
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:20,461
to the Golden Gate Park is
worth the effort. You'll pass

42
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,741
buffaloes, windmills, the
Academy of Arts and Science,

43
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:30,221
and the Flower Conservatory all
on your way to the Pacific. Now

44
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,141
kick your feet up in luxury at
Sutro's Curvehouse. Stylish

45
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:37,021
restaurant and lounge with
stunning panoramic views.

46
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:42,301
Perfect place to unwind and
watch the sunset.
