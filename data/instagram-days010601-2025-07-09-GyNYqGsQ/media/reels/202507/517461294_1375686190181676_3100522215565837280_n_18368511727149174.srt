1
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:11,841
London, it's easy to recognize.
But look closely at a map. In

2
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:16,081
the very centre, there's a one
square mile cutout. This is the

3
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:21,761
city of London which lives in a
city named London.

4
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:30,401
The city has its own mayor,
laws and police force. In fact,

5
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:33,441
it behaves more like a separate
country within the United

6
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:37,041
Kingdom. This is because the
cities been around for much

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,961
longer than the UK. It was
built by the Romans and has

8
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:46,001
remained semi autonomous ever
since. To embody its fiery

9
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,681
independence, the city's emblem
is a dragon, not a bad choice.

10
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:53,681
You'll spot these statues, they
guard the boundary of the

11
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,561
square mile.

12
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,601
Nowadays, the cities arguably
the financial capital of the

13
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:07,141
world. And London is the
world's biggest foreign

14
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:12,961
exchange market. But the city
has a tiny residential

15
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,201
population. Every weekday,
workers flood into the banks,

16
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:22,001
law firms, and offices which
fill the square mile.

17
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:29,621
But it's not all work. This is
1 PM. You might say no surprise

18
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:33,381
here city workers having a
drink but attitudes are

19
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:37,061
changing. The legendary long
lunch at the pub is now seen as

20
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:42,181
a bit of a macho relic. In 2017
Lloyds of London the legendary

21
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,941
insurance market told its
employees the party's over. No

22
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,541
more drinks during office
hours. But as you can see not

23
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:55,161
everyone got the memo. Because
here's the rub of it. The city

24
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:58,681
had a bit of a reputation. When
the after work crowd go home,

25
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:04,081
the place becomes a ghost town.
But that's changing and leading

26
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:08,881
the way are some high flying
dining spots. Sitting on top of

27
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,361
the Herron Tower is the Duck
and Waffle. It offers

28
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:16,721
twenty-four seven service with
a hell of a view. This is about

29
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:22,461
as refined as a twenty-four
hour waffle house gets. But the

30
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,421
most talked about new guest is
reinventing the city's

31
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:29,661
reputation is called the Ned.
Over 500 million pounds has

32
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:32,301
been spent turning this old
bank into a private members

33
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,981
club and hotel. With eight
restaurants in the lobby and a

34
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:39,581
bar that stays open till four
AM the Ned's injected some late

35
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:46,321
night atmosphere into the city.
This is after all the oldest

36
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,401
part of London and following an
injection of fun and flavor,

37
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,881
it's throwing down a challenge
to the rest of the city and

38
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:57,121
shaking off its stuffy
reputation.
