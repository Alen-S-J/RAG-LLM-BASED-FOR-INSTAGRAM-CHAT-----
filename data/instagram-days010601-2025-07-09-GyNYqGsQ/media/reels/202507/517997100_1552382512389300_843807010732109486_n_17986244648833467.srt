1
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:08,001
Singapore is a truly
international city. There are

2
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,601
four official languages but
you'll hear dozens more on the

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:18,001
streets of this island city
state. Half the population is

4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,921
temporary stopping in to work
or study for short stints and

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:25,681
that constant coming and going
creates a vibrant mix of

6
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,401
cultures.

7
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,861
Tucked under Malaysia,
Singapore was only founded in

8
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,541
nineteensixty-five. It's now
one of the richest nations in

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,261
the world and a global
financial hub.

10
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:51,761
Singapore invested a whopping 1
billion dollars in startups and

11
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:57,801
37, 000 international companies
are based here. The first thing

12
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:01,081
you need to know about
Singapore is it's not all work.

13
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:04,841
The city now claims six of the
world's best bars plus

14
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:09,161
forty-seven Michelin stars.

15
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:14,801
So let's start here at the
Swanky Atlas Bar. Front and

16
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,761
centre is the Colossal Gin
Tower packed with over 1000

17
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:23,041
varieties. This art deco bar
opened last year and was

18
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:28,701
quickly rated in the world's
top twenty. But if you're

19
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:32,061
looking for something a little
less shouty, then head over to

20
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:35,021
Deep Espoke.

21
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:40,581
The gins a style bar is
regularly rated one of the best

22
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:44,501
cocktail spots in the city.
It's sleek and sumptuous

23
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:51,861
interior draws in a sharply
dressed crowd. But you don't

24
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,901
have to spend a fortune to
enjoy the breadth of what

25
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,181
Singapore has to offer. The
city state has three major

26
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:03,621
ethnic groups. Chinese, Malay
and Indian. To have a taste of

27
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:06,821
the more traditional and
colourful side of Singapore.

28
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:10,581
Plan a day trip to the cultural
enclaves of Chinatown, Little

29
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:15,921
India or the Arab Quarter I But
if you want to eat where the

30
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:22,821
chefs choose to eat, try this.
Burntends is not a good option

31
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:26,821
for vegetarians. It specializes
in grilled meats and has become

32
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:30,901
a favorite of local and
visiting chefs. Set up by two

33
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,701
Australians, this modern
barbecue restaurant is famous

34
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:39,061
for its open kitchen and super
heated coal oven.

35
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,681
It's actually illegal to rent
out private homes in Singapore

36
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:48,321
so stick to hotels. This is the
Hyatt Anders Hotel one of many

37
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:53,201
luxury options. We have saved
what's probably Singapore's

38
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:56,401
most famous hotel and bar for
last and that's because you

39
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,841
can't get in there at the
moment. Raffles Hotel is where

40
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:03,361
the Singapore sling was
invented and it's reopening in

41
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:09,361
the fall of 2018 after a
massive reconstruction.

42
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:13,241
Finally, if you find yourself
with some downtime, go to see

43
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,401
the audacious gardens by the
bay. Populated with giant super

44
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:22,661
trees, these structures are
really huge hanging gardens.

45
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,661
The total cost of this public
park was $1 billion dollars.

46
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:30,981
Part of a push by Singapore to
transform into what they call a

47
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:34,421
city in a garden.
