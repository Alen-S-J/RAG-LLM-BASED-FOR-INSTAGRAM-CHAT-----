1
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:14,241
Cambridge, could you imagine a
more idyllic university town?

2
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:18,941
With its narrow medieval
passageways and eight hundred

3
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:22,781
and 1 year old university, this
small English city is packed

4
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:27,181
with history. But Cambridge is
embracing the new, its

5
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:30,301
restaurant scene has moved on
from Pub Grub and has something

6
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:37,661
exciting yet still traditional
to offer. Welcome to Cambridge.

7
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:48,721
Cambridge is less than an hour
from London by train. Once

8
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,361
you've arrived, you're going to
want to do what the locals do

9
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,721
and get yourself a bike.
Cambridge is considered the

10
00:00:54,721 --> 00:01:01,041
cycling capital of the UK.
They're everywhere. Bike hire

11
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,281
shops are peppered around and
parking is easy but be warned.

12
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,761
In 2017, the Cambridge District
had one of the highest rates of

13
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:16,441
bike theft in England and Wales
so lock it up. In the centre of

14
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,481
Cambridge is one of the world's
most well known and respected

15
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:23,241
universities. Founded in twelve
hundred and 8, it's the fourth

16
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:28,461
oldest university in the world
still teaching. One of the

17
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:31,901
jewels in the university's
crown is its libraries and this

18
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:35,981
is the big one. Cambridge
University Library holds around

19
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:40,621
8 million books, manuscripts,
maps and journals and it was

20
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:45,101
thought some more salacious
material. For a long time, it

21
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:49,021
was undergraduate folk law that
the library tower held a vast

22
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:54,061
stockpile of Victorian-aged
pornography but no. This year,

23
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,261
the tower opened up its secrets
and revealed it was used to

24
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,901
store books and other items
thought to be not good enough

25
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,381
for the main building. This
material is now regarded as an

26
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:06,501
important resource.

27
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:14,441
One of the best ways to see
Cambridge's hidden spots is by

28
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:21,261
boat or punt to be exact.
Punting began in the early 20th

29
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:25,181
century and remains the best
way to explore the river cam

30
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:32,181
and its many bridges, 25 in
all. This is the mathematical

31
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:35,701
bridge. Despite looking curved,
it's actually made entirely of

32
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:40,861
straight timber. Safely on dry
land, it's time for a pint.

33
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:46,261
This is the eagle. It was here
in 1953 that Francis Creek

34
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:50,021
charged in interrupting lunch
time service to announce that

35
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,621
he and James Watson had
discovered the secret of life.

36
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:57,141
How DNA carries genetic
information. Hope someone

37
00:02:57,141 --> 00:03:00,961
offered him a drink. Keeping
with Tradition just a few

38
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:04,641
meters down the road is Chop
House. This no nonsense steak

39
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:08,401
restaurant has a classic
English menu. Try the sticky

40
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:12,321
toffee pudding if you got room.

41
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,561
But it's not all old England.
This is Pint Shop which offers

42
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:24,961
23 tap craft beers and 100 gin
options.

43
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:29,601
There are plenty of places to
stay in the city but if you

44
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,641
want to get some country air,
just a short drive out of town

45
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:36,641
is Clopton Courtyard. Here you
can rent your own barn, there

46
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,521
are six to choose from and
enjoy the quintessentially

47
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,881
English countryside
surroundings. Not a bad spot to

48
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:48,121
finish off your day. You.
