1
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:08,241
Nestled between rolling hills
Rwanda's capital is friendly

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:14,081
and welcoming confounding Creek
inceptions because twenty-four

3
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,841
years after the genocide which
shocked the world Kigali's

4
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,881
worked hard to reinvent itself
with its eyes on the future

5
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,641
with a host of startups a
burgeoning art scene great

6
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:27,921
dining and some of the world's
best coffee this African

7
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:30,721
capital is building a
reputation with tourists

8
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:34,881
welcome to Kigali

9
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:46,081
With a population of just over
1. 1 million people, Kigali is

10
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,641
both geographically and
culturally the centre of

11
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:52,721
Rwanda. Its streets are
spotlessly clean, crime is low

12
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,801
and the economy is growing.
Kigali is capturing tourists

13
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,841
who used to only pass through
on their way to safari or

14
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,241
gorilla tours. After the
shocking events of nineteen

15
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:06,641
ninety-four, the city and the
country wants to show the world

16
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:11,601
another side and create a new
legacy.

17
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:17,821
Gagali is trying to model its
economic growth of the likes of

18
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,901
Singapore and Seoul complete
with a city wide obsession with

19
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,181
keeping the streets clean.
Citizens are required once a

20
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:28,141
month to partake in a giant
neighbourhood cleaning effort.

21
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,901
On top of that it's illegal to
import, use or sell plastic

22
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:35,341
bags and it's taken very
seriously. Plastic bag

23
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,781
traffickers yeah that's a thing
have been fined and even

24
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:42,381
jailed. As a tourist you'll be
warned not to bring any into

25
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:46,441
the country when you arrive.
Staying in the city's easy with

26
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,241
over a hundred hotels including
the big names like the

27
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:53,161
Marriott, Radison Blue and the
Hilton. But arguably the best

28
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:58,841
known is the Hotel Demil
Colleen. It was here in 1994

29
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:03,641
that 1200 people took refuge
during the genocide. That story

30
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:08,521
inspired the film Hotel Rwanda.
Got trouble at the gate. At the

31
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,121
time it was the city's premium
spot. But these days newer

32
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,801
hotels offer more luxury.
Despite that sitting in the

33
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:20,301
lobby you can feel the charm is
here.

34
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:25,841
Internationally, Rwanda Coffee
is regarded as the best in East

35
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:32,021
Africa. But it's not popular
with the locals. Rwanda's are

36
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,621
more into tea. But despite this
Kigali has a handful of

37
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:39,061
excellent coffee shops. This is
Questioned Coffee where the

38
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:43,661
beans are sourced from female
farmers and roasted in house.

39
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,981
And this is Shokola CafÃ© a
trendy spot above Kigali's

40
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:52,781
public library. Here's a tip
when heading out. Dress up. The

41
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:56,221
locals look sharp and wandering
around in some old T-shirt and

42
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:02,181
shorts is not going to cut it.
When travelling around the

43
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,301
city, you'll notice bright
murals dotted around. This is

44
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:09,221
the work of a public art social
enterprise. In a city with

45
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:12,981
almost no graffiti. This is
public art supported by the

46
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:16,101
government. So it's more
positive messages than free

47
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:20,421
thinking street art anarchy but
the scene here is maturing.

48
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:24,021
There are a number of boutique
shops where you can pick up

49
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:27,541
some of the local arts and
crafts. This is Go Kigali

50
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,901
Boutique which also offers city
tours that will show you around

51
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:35,141
the town's most exciting bots.

52
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:39,121
Finally finish off your day
with a drink looking over the

53
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,561
city at the Hilton's new hotel
in the centre of town. With a

54
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,841
80 degree views and an
excellent cocktail menu watch

55
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:50,881
the sunset in style. Because
with so much excellent food,

56
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:55,441
drink and ease. Kigali could
well become a tourist must see

57
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:59,441
in the next few years. So get
in quick before the crowd

58
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,081
arrives.
