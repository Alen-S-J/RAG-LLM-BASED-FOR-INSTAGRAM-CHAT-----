Now, I love Disneyland and Cambridge is very pretty indeed, prettier than Oxford on the surface, but I don't mean this as a compliment in this context. There is a hollowness to Cambridge. It is like a Pepper's Ghost trick of something probably going on at Oxford. It is flat and the people and weather can be kind of icy. It is not somewhere that I would feel 'looked after'. Cambridge, being situated in more of a cultural vacuum than Oxford in terms of the counties that surround it, has, in a way, regrettably easily absorbed much of that anonymous 'I don't care about you' London energy. It is a bit bizarre that an equal of Oxford ever found sufficient footing there. I look at the front of King's College Cambridge and it's just an ornate facade. I might as well be looking at Brighton Pavillion."

It was worth every penny! Of course the California Coast, Lake Tahoe, New Zealand and the beautiful Islands of the Philippines are beautiful - but Bora Bora just beats everything I've seen.

I was floored that in\nthe middle of July the high's were only in the 60's, and the lows in the lower 50's.  Us east coasters are not use to that in summer :)"

Lived in nearby Marina and walked it's cold beaches, slept in my car overnight at the vista view of Bixby Bridge, dinners on Cannery Row, frequent visits to Carmel and drives down Big Sur on Hwy 1 all the way to Morro Bay. Breathtaking sceneries that will never be erased in my memory."

Bordeaux became the most attracting place to live in France those few last years. Real estate rose up and public transportation was over saturated. Make a long story short the city has lost a great deal of its character. Please DO NOT COME \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082 !"

Instead of going to pinpoints on a map, you should go aimlessly across the streets of Bordeaux and let it amazes you. One of the places that left a memorable mark on me, where I should have stayed longer."
