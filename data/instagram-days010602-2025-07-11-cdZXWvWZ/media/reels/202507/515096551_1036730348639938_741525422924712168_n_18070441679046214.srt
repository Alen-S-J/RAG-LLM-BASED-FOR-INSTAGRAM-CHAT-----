1
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,341
Picture New York City and
you're probably thinking about

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,181
Midtown, Times Square, the
Empire State Building, Grand

3
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:18,601
Central. This is Midtown
Manhattan. Tourists flock to it

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:23,801
while locals often try and fail
to avoid it. But there's more

5
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:26,441
to this part of town than
tourist traps and traffic

6
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:31,081
congestion. Midtown has been
electrified by a bolt of

7
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,921
Brooklyn Hip and Wall Street
money. Maybe it's time you took

8
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:37,801
a second look.

9
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:46,921
Midtown is everything between
14th street and Central Park

10
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:52,441
South. It's the world's largest
central business district. It

11
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:56,201
also has some of the most
expensive real estate and it

12
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:59,481
doesn't get any ritzier than
fifth Avenue which commands the

13
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:06,001
world's highest retail rents.
But if there's one building

14
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,921
more responsible than any other
for Midtown success, it's this

15
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:12,401
one.

16
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:19,781
Built in 1913, Grand Central
Terminal helped spark a boom in

17
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:22,781
construction that made Midtown
the centre of American

18
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:27,701
capitalism. This audacious
building is used by more than a

19
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:31,701
million people a week. A
century after it was built, it

20
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:37,541
has only now reached capacity.
That's future proofing.

21
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:44,881
New York embraces eating out.
There are over 45, 000

22
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:50,561
restaurants in the city. It
would take 125 years to eat in

23
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:57,481
everyone, not saying you
should. Here in Midtown the

24
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,401
restaurant scene is embracing
change. A number of Brooklyn

25
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:05,321
institutions have jumped the
river.

26
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:10,421
Roberta's Pizza started on the
other side of the East River in

27
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,821
2008 but their second outpost
is based in Urban Space Food

28
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,141
Hall SmackDab in Midtown.

29
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,801
You could be fooled into
thinking this is Williamsburg

30
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,241
not Park Ave.

31
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:32,421
Another Brooklyn import is
Ichiran, the Japanese ramen

32
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:35,941
chain whose first US restaurant
opened in Bushwick in twenty

33
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:41,221
sixteen. Here you can sit with
a group or in splendid

34
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,501
isolation in one of the
so-called flavor concentration

35
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:51,801
booths. Very serious. But if
you want to swap Brooklyn cool

36
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:56,361
for something a bit more
luxury, we've got the spot. The

37
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,601
office is an intimate speakeasy
offering pre-prohibition style

38
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:06,441
cocktails and a food menu to
match. You'll find it hidden

39
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:12,761
away on the 35th floor of the
super swanky Mandarin Oriental.

40
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:16,701
This is one of the most
expensive hotels in New York.

41
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:23,501
Rooms start at around $1, 000 a
night. But there are 113 other

42
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:29,621
hotels in Midtown offering
plenty of choices. So forget

43
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:32,341
the old wisdom that the
excitement is basically

44
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:36,501
anywhere but Midtown. This part
of Manhattan has something new

45
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:40,341
and exciting to offer whether
it's high end or rough and

46
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,741
ready.
