1
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:10,981
This is the Chinese mega city
of Shenzhen. A gleaming

2
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:18,001
monument to China's economic
miracle. In 1980 it was a town

3
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:22,481
with around 60, thousand
residents. Now it's China's

4
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:28,481
technological hub with a
population of over 12 million.

5
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:34,261
Entrepreneurs, high-flying tech
graduates and international

6
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:40,701
companies flock here to join
the tech revolution. Welcome to

7
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:43,581
Shenzhen.

8
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:53,581
Shenzhen sits north of Hong
Kong in the Pearl River Delta.

9
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,781
One of the most densely
urbanised regions in the world.

10
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,461
The area has an estimated
population of one hundred and

11
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:06,621
20 million people. In 1980,
Shenzhen was dedicated a free

12
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:11,021
economic zone and experiment in
market capitalism in communist

13
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:15,421
China. The effects were
explosive. Shenzhen's

14
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:20,541
population skyrocketed in just
over 30 years.

15
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:25,421
The city has a massive migrant
workforce. Over 4 million

16
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:28,781
residents stay during the week
and then return home on the

17
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:34,221
weekend. But it's tech hardware
that's put this city on the

18
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:38,381
map. If Silicon Valley dreams
it up then this is where it's

19
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:44,801
made. This is Bay Market,
arguably the world's largest

20
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,921
electronics market. Filming
here is banned. Hi, hi, hi, hi,

21
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:53,561
hi. But here's a sneaky peek.
The market's neon lit corridors

22
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:57,401
stretch across multiple
buildings and many floors. The

23
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:01,001
stalls sell everything from the
latest gadgets to the tiniest

24
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:05,561
screws and many items are rip
offs. Chinese fakes of US

25
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:10,041
products. But if you wanted to,
you could buy all you need to

26
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:16,481
build your own smartphone or
100000 of them. Because

27
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:20,481
Shenzhen draws in workers from
across China, its food scene is

28
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:24,641
just as varied as its
population.

29
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:29,601
If you're looking for the full
banquet experience, Shane

30
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:34,881
Palace and the Shangrila Hotel
has got you covered. Their

31
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:38,801
dimsung lunch is a feast for
the eyes and the mouth. It's a

32
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:45,441
showcase of authentic cantonese
cuisine. Try something a little

33
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:50,561
more casual such as Chinese hot
pot. A simmering pot of soup

34
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,201
stock is kept on your table and
you put your choice of

35
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:57,041
ingredients in. One of the most
famous variations is flavoured

36
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:01,281
with citron pepper. So watch
out. It packs a serious spicy

37
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:07,261
punch. When you get the bill,
you'll notice QR codes. Here in

38
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:10,061
Shenzhen, they're used by
locals to pay for just about

39
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,261
everything. Simply scan the
code and the money is

40
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:17,501
transferred. Sounds great but
there's a hitch. You can't use

41
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,941
them unless you have a Chinese
bank account. So, a technology

42
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:25,901
to make life easier only works
if you're a local.

43
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:31,681
Finally, why not enjoy some
sport? Look at that. Shenzhen

44
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:35,521
style. Attacking the blue
engineer. This is Robomaster, a

45
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:40,661
competition put on by local
drone and tech company DJI.

46
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,581
Student teams from around the
world compete using a variety

47
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:48,021
of self-made robots to shoot
each other and destroy the

48
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,501
opposition base. Racer
ammunition as well. That's

49
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,061
right. The competition aims to
foster engineering and

50
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:57,061
programming and keep Shenzhen
at the forefront of the tech

51
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,861
revolution.
