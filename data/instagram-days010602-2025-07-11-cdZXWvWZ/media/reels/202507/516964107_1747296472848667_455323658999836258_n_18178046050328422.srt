1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:07,081
The Australia's Gold Coast is
situated in subtropical

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:10,761
Queensland just an hours drive
from the state capital Brisbane

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:14,681
it's a fast growing city of a
half a million people drawn by

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:19,661
the miles of perfect coastline
and a sun drenched lifestyle

5
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:23,421
The Central Gold Coast skyline
looks like a gathering of

6
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:29,541
giants wriggling their toes in
the warm Pacific. There's a

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,901
natural spirit here found in
the incredible beaches, the

8
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:36,421
ocean's shifting moods, and the
cool waterfalls and deep

9
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:40,261
forests of the Hinderland. But
there's a human spirit too.

10
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:45,141
Dedicated to family, vitality,
and having the time of your

11
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:50,181
life. The Gold Coast got it
start as a vacation retreat in

12
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:54,501
the 1850s near its northern
end. It's here that the Gold

13
00:00:54,501 --> 00:01:00,021
Coast still shines brightest.
So Surfers Paradise is a

14
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:04,181
complete destination in itself.
A glittering resort, shopping,

15
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,981
and entertainment strip. Head
to the sky point observation

16
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:13,141
deck to see the Gold Coast
beaches unfurl in a twenty mile

17
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,421
ribbon of sand studded with
headlands, parks, and

18
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:22,121
waterways. Just to the south of
Surfers Paradise is Broad Beach

19
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:26,041
where the pace begins to slow.
The further you move down the

20
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:30,521
coast, the more relaxed the
vibe. Burleigh Heads is home to

21
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:33,881
a stunning national park and
one of Australia's legendary

22
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,761
surf breaks.

23
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:46,681
It's easy to see why this
headlamp has been an Aboriginal

24
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:51,941
gathering place for thousands
of years. A little further

25
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:56,141
south is Currumbin, a place
where the bush meets the beach.

26
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,181
Hit the waves between Elephant
and Currumbin rocks or just go

27
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:04,661
for a float in the sparkling
serenity of the estuary. Follow

28
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:08,341
the shoreline south to the Gold
Coast most southern beach side

29
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:12,181
neighborhood. Coolangatta. Just
a five minute drive from the

30
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:15,221
Gold Coast International
Airport. Coolangatta is the

31
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,181
region's gateway for most
international and interstate

32
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,321
visitors. With a parks,
sheltered beaches, and river,

33
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:25,521
Coolangatta is a popular choice
for families and when the

34
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,881
conditions arrive, it produces
some of the most spectacular

35
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:32,241
surf in Australia.

36
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:39,401
The Gold Coast offers plenty of
thrills besides its fabulous

37
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:44,161
coastline. It's the theme park
capital of Australia. Spend a

38
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:48,961
day riding the waves and water
slides at Wet and Wild. Just up

39
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,161
the road, cool off and ride the
tubes at Dream World's

40
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:56,241
Whitewater World. Dream World
is Australia's largest theme

41
00:02:56,241 --> 00:03:00,641
park. It features over 40 rides
for all ages and themed lands

42
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:04,081
like Tiger Island,

43
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:08,921
Experience Hollywood on the
Gulf Coast at Warner Brothers

44
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,601
Movie World. Strap yourself in
and take off on some of the

45
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:15,881
best roller coasters down
under. Then buckle up for the

46
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,721
Hollywood Stunt Driver Show.

47
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:25,081
Next door at the Australian
Outback Spectacular, saddle up

48
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:28,201
to a three-course meal as some
of the country's best horsemen

49
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:32,521
and women celebrate the spirit
of the bush. At SeaWorld,

50
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:35,241
celebrate the spirit of the
ocean with some of the sea's

51
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:38,841
most endearing creatures and a
few of the less cuffly ones

52
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:42,761
too. There's also plenty of
rides to explore between the

53
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,241
shows.

54
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:51,041
If you're feeling the need to
settle the nerves after all

55
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,281
those theme parks, head for the
hills. Just a 30 minute drive

56
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:58,881
in land and perched high on the
rim of an ancient volcano is

57
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:04,941
Mount Tamborine. Explore the
rainforest trails and skywalk

58
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:08,381
before sampling the local
produce and wines at Tambourine

59
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,941
Village.

60
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:17,161
A little further south is
Springbrook, a world heritage

61
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:20,841
listed national park filled
with ancient forests, secret

62
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:24,201
places, and waterfalls that
have been flowing since the

63
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:27,401
dawn of time.

64
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,601
From up here, high on the
escarpment, the Gold Coast

65
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:36,921
beckons. Back to the sand, back
to the right, and back to the

66
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:41,881
spirit of Australia's favorite
beach destination.
