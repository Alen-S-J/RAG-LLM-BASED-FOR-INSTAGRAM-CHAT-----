        "value": "I think technology and products produced in Shenzen can be said as one of innovation product because Shenzen is the first city ever that named as National Self-Innovation Demonstration Zone. shenzhen has long placed innovation as a leading strategy in its development by using innovation to improve the quality of both economic and industrial development. \n\n1. They have open source and they create new/latest product innovation and it\nis not solely for the market but it is to gain and develop new ideas for high and\nmiddle technology in the new era. - For example, from the documentary video itself they innovates phone from previous or new produced phone to different specification according to their customer\nrequirement. The most surprising part is they already succeed in imitates\nphone that are not yet release in the market. Fast pace technology helps them\nto growth new innovation faster than any advanced country. As they also create no just for the market but for their ideas and hobby. \n\n2. They have everything you need to get things done. Every equipment are\navailable in the store. If in the west you need approximately 9 to 12 months to\nget equipment shipment to fully finish your prototype but in china only 3\nmonths you can get things done. As fast as lightning or even faster than that. -For example, in Huaqiangbei there is more than 800-900 stores inside the\nbuilding itself. As Malaysian, if you think Plaza Lowyat have every technology\nyou need imagine living in China specifically in Shenzhen and Huaqiangbei. On top of that, regardless any age you are, you can create new innovation based on what is in the market. They teach kids at age of 8 years old to start building and learning to use coding/programming. One of the kid managed to create one software to remind his mom to pick up the key whenever she is going out. Every day is a new day of innovation product produce at there."

Broadbeach, Surfers Paradise, Burleigh Heads and Coolangatta are just stunning places to go. I also went to O'Reilly's near the Mount Tambourine and the place was heavenly beautiful. Thank you for making a good video of the Gold Coast. I cannot wait to go there again someday!"

LBJ brokered a deal with Humble (now ExxonMobil) to write-off an old oil field ( Clear Lake ) to the federal government to become the new site for NASA Mission Control."

Forget walking around the galleria and boring your guest to death.\nhike through memorial park one day, hit the zoo and aquariuam the next, get shit faced at an astros game and ride your bike down the buffalo bayou trail (after you sober up) to catch a concert in the theater district, catch the light rail and get hammered at Mollys on main and shoot some pool before heading to the johnson space center and finding out dehydrated space ice cream doesnt mix with whiskey and getting emotional seeing the astronaut dedication films (because of the whiskey) then drag race down westheimer at 2 in the morning!"
