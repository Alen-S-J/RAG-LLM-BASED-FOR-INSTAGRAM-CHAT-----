00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:08,181
The design of this bottle
started in Terre Haute, Indiana

2
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:12,981
in 1915. At the time, Coca-Cola
was being sold at soda

3
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:16,901
fountains or in a glass bottle
called A Hutchinson. But this

4
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:20,581
simple straight sided bottle
was easy to copy and imitations

5
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,421
were flooding the market. The
solution, a national contest

6
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,941
for a new bottle that would
make Coca-Cola stand out. Even

7
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,381
if the bottle were broken or
you touch it in the dark. The

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,661
root glass company got to work
on their competition entry.

9
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,581
Looking up the word Coca in the
encyclopedia and coming across

10
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:43,881
an illustration for a cocoa
pod. The curvy ridge shape

11
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,841
appeal to the team who used it
as the basis for their winning

12
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:51,881
design. The first bottles hit
the shelves just a year later.

13
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:54,681
With the added touch of the
glass being coloured German

14
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:59,001
green. Later changed to Georgia
green. In honor of the Coca

15
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,721
Cola company's home state.
Sleek and iconic. This is the

16
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,361
design that's flaunted its
curves to become the trademark

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:10,521
of the most popular drink in
the world.
