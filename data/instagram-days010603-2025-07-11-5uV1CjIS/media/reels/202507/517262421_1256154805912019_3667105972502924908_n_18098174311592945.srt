00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:06,881
The design of this shoe starts
in Oregon in 1981 and with a

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,961
man called Tinker Hatfield. He
was an architect for Nike hired

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:14,481
to drop offices and showrooms
on the company's campus. After

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,361
making a statement on the
outside of the buildings, he

5
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:22,081
was asked to join the designers
on the inside. In a race to

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,041
develop sneakers, a former Nasa
engineer had recently

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,481
introduced the idea of sealing
air bubbles in the soles for

8
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:32,701
extra comfort and performance.
But competition was fierce and

9
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:37,181
Nike still needed an edge.
Hatfield headed to Paris in

10
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:40,621
search of inspiration. While he
was there, he visited the

11
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:44,141
Pompadu Center. A radical
building famous for its inside

12
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:47,581
out design which exposed the
building's components like

13
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,541
escalators and heating pipes
for everyone to see. Hatfield

14
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,741
decided to apply the same
principle to his own design.

15
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,781
Revealing the inner workings of
the shoe by making the air

16
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:03,521
cushioning system visible. The
team thought the air bubble

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,201
would seem like a weakness. But
the Nike Air Max one was an

18
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:11,441
instant hit when it launched in
19eighty-seven. Originally

19
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:18,001
pairs sold for $75. Now they go
for double that. Today Tinker

20
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,881
Hatfield is one of the most
successful shoe designers in

21
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,641
the world. He even created
those legendary self-lacing

22
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:30,241
sneakers a back to the future
fame. Stylish and innovative.

23
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:34,461
This is the design that stayed
one step ahead simply by being

24
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,901
turned inside out.
