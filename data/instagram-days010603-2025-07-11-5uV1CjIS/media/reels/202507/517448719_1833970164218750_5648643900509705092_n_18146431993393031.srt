00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:05,281
The design of the modern tennis
racket goes back to England in

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:08,881
eighteen seventy-four. And a
man named Major Walter Clofton

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:12,641
Wingfield. Wingfield patented
the rules for a game known as

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:16,081
lawn tennis. Standardizing
elements like balls, nets, and

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:19,841
rackets. For the next century,
rackets would be made of wood

6
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:23,601
and remain similar in shape to
Wingfield's original design.

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:28,241
But in 1961, French tennis
legend Renee Lacoste unveiled a

8
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:32,321
radical invention. The
crocodile as he was nicknamed,

9
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:36,721
had made a prototype using
metal. Just a few years Wilson

10
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:40,161
released the T2 thousand. The
first stainless steel racket

11
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:43,441
whose futuristic design caught
the eye of players like Billie

12
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:47,601
Jean King and Jimmy Connors.
It's small head and open throat

13
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,881
reduced air resistance and
helped Connors win the US Open

14
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:56,561
five times. The 1970s ushered
in an era of aluminum which was

15
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:00,401
lighter and easier to mold and
steel. This was followed by

16
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,921
fashionable oversized rackets
that had a larger sweet spot

17
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:07,581
and gave players more
Eventually, the quest for

18
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,021
lightness and durability led to
graphite rackets as well as

19
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:15,901
other materials like Kevlar and
graphene. Today, Wilson and

20
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:19,421
French brand Babylot dominate
both the men's and women's game

21
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:23,741
with the two brands winning 71%
of professional tournaments in

22
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:28,141
twenty seventeen. Precise and
powerful, this is the design

23
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:33,261
that's helped to create legends
with every stroke.
