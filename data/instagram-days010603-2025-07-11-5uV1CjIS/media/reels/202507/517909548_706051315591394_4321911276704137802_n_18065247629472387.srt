1
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:07,941
The design of this little
tree's car freshener goes way

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,341
back to 1952 in Watertown, New
York. And an unhappy milkman

3
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:15,061
who's complaining to one of his
customers about the bad smell

4
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:19,061
of spoiled milk. Lucky for him,
he was talking to Julius

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,181
Salmon, a Jewish chemist who'd
fled from Nazi Germany and

6
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:25,541
spent time living in the forest
of Canada studying the aroma of

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:30,021
alpine trees. After his chance
of counter with a milkman,

8
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:34,581
salmon started to create paper
soaked in natural pine oil. A

9
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:38,301
string was all attached to stop
people getting the perfume all

10
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:43,021
over their hands. The freshener
was originally in the shape of

11
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:46,381
a Bucksham pinup girl but
salmon changed its design to

12
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,301
the pine tree we know today.
This allowed the cellophane

13
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,741
wrapper to be rolled down
slowly so the fragrance would

14
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:59,161
last that little bit longer. As
the automotive industry took

15
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:03,321
off, so did little trees.
Filling the air with classics

16
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:07,081
like black ice, royal pine,
vanilla aroma, and of course

17
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,041
new car scent. Fragrant and
affordable, this is the design

18
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:15,641
that brings you the heady aroma
of a Canadian woodland. Whether

19
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:20,281
you're in a milk cart or taxi
cap.
