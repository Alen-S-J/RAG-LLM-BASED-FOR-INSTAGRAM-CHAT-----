00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,721
The designing of this logo
began in Seattle in nineteen

2
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:10,801
seventy-one. With three
university friends who really

3
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:14,961
liked coffee. They also really
liked the Herman Melville novel

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:18,801
Loby Dick. So much so they
decided to name their company

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:24,001
after Captain Ahab's ship. But
branding exec Terry Heckler

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,761
decided P Quad Coffee didn't
sound quite right. So they went

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:32,161
with the name of the first
mate, Starbucks. Heckler then

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,041
trolled through maritime books
and found a 15th century

9
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:40,261
woodcut of a two-tailed siren.
In of luring sailors onto the

10
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:43,541
rocks, this mythical mermaid
would call people to come and

11
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,381
grab a cup of coffee.
Initially, her chest was bare

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,221
but after some complaints,
Peckler redrew the design with

13
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,821
long hair that covered her
body. The logo also went from

14
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:59,941
brown to green. A symbol of
freshness and growth. In 2011,

15
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,501
the Starbucks Siren was
redesigned with rounder

16
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:05,781
details. A longer shadow was
also introduced on the right

17
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:09,521
side of her nose. A small
element of asymmetry which made

18
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:14,321
her feel more human. She can be
spotted in 76 countries and

19
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,681
markets. Helping Starbucks to
reach a brand value of more

20
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:23,041
than eight point seven billion
dollars. Bold and alluring,

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,561
this is the design that started
with a myth and became a coffee

22
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,361
legend.
