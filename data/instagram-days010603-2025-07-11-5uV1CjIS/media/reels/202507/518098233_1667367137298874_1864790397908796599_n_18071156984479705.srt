00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:10,381
The design of this soy sauce
bottle goes back to 1945 in

2
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,181
Japan. A teenager named Kenji
Ekwan had witnessed the

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,141
aftermath of the atomic bomb
falling on his hometown

4
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:21,581
Hiroshima and was mourning the
loss of his sister and father.

5
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:26,621
After seeing the devastation,
Ekwan's path changed. He first

6
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,141
enrolled as a Buddhist monk
falling in the footsteps of his

7
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:33,581
father. But instead he decided
to become a creator of things

8
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:38,681
and bring happiness to people.
As a designer Aguan got a

9
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:41,961
contract to design a table top
soy sauce bottle for food

10
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:46,681
company Kikoman soy sauce is a
must for Japanese meals but it

11
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,681
was originally sold in big
bottles that were hard to hold

12
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,521
it took Aguan three years and
about 100 prototypes to

13
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,841
complete the design in 1961.
The result is a small glass

14
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,721
bottle with a narrow neck. A
shape reminiscent of

15
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:05,801
traditional Japanese sake
flasks. It allows you to see

16
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:09,321
how much sauce is left. It's
stable on surfaces and

17
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:13,641
comfortable to hold. The inward
angle of the tip of the spout

18
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:18,121
is also perfect at preventing
drips and controlling flow. The

19
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,241
design of the little soy sauce
bottle was just the start of

20
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,001
Equan's great journey. He also
went on to create other icons

21
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:32,121
of Japanese design. In Japan,
Ekwan has become almost as

22
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:36,441
recognizable as his bottle and
50 years later, still appeared

23
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:40,361
in commercials for the soy
sauce. Today, the bottle can be

24
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:43,321
found on the tables of homes
and restaurants in more than a

25
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,521
hundred countries and in two
thousand fifteen, the bottle

26
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,801
was even exhibited at the
Museum of Modern Art New York.

27
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:54,041
Simple but elegant. This is the
design made to create a small

28
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:59,321
moment of happiness without you
even knowing it.
