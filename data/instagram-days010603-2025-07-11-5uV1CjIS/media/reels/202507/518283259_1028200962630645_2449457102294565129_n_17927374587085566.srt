00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:06,661
The design of this board game
started nineteen oh four with a

2
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:09,781
woman named Elizabeth McGee.
She was a fan of a book called

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:13,461
Progress and Poverty by
economist Henry George. In it

4
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,301
he argued that renting out land
only profited a few individuals

5
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,581
at the expense of the
community. To teach people

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,861
about George's theories, Lizzie
McGee created a game with two

7
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:27,461
sets of rules. In one, players
all shared money when someone

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,741
purchased a piece of land and
in the other, everyone tried to

9
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:34,021
get as rich as possible while
bankrupting others. This way,

10
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:37,861
she hoped people would see how
unfair land grabbing was. The

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,461
landlord game as it was known
became popular particularly

12
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:45,301
among Quakers. With each person
drawing the board by hand onto

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,861
table cloths or fabric and
modifying the rules. One of

14
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:53,541
those people was Charles
Darrow. He would only use the

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,261
rules that were cutthroat and
made a version of the board in

16
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:59,781
the shape of his dining table.
He also took street names from

17
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:02,781
Atlantic City grouping them by
color and adding small

18
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,581
illustrations to create the
board we know today. When

19
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:09,461
Parker Brothers bought the
rights to Monopoly from Darrow

20
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:13,941
in 193five, they soon added a
Portly mascot with a top hat in

21
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,861
cane. Rumored to be modeled on
wealthy banker JP Morgan. They

22
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:21,781
also distributed every set with
metal tokens inspired by

23
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,901
trinkets Darrow had used for
his niece's charm bracelet.

24
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:28,341
Within a year of the release,
thirty-five, thousand copies of

25
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:31,781
Monopoly were being made each
week. Now more than one billion

26
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:36,421
people in 114 countries have
played the game. Classic and

27
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,621
familiar, this is the design
that set out to make us work

28
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:44,741
together but has been dividing
families ever since.
