The design of this soy sauce bottle goes back to 1945 in Japan. A teenager named Kenji Ekwan had witnessed the aftermath of the atomic bomb falling on his hometown Hiroshima and was mourning the loss of his sister and father. After seeing the devastation, Ekwan's path changed. He first enrolled as a Buddhist monk, falling in the footsteps of his father, but instead he decided to become a creator of things and bring happiness to people. As a young designer, Ekwan got a contract to design a tabletop soy sauce bottle for food company Kikamon. Soy sauce is a must for Japanese meals, but it was originally sold in big bottles that were hard to hold. It took Ekwan three years and about 100 prototypes to complete the design in 1961. The result is a small glass bottle with a narrow neck, a shaped reminiscent of traditional Japanese sake flasks. It allows you to see how much sauce is left, it's stable on surfaces and comfortable to hold. The inward angle of the tip of the spout is also perfect at preventing drips and controlling flows. The design of the little soy sauce bottle was just the start of Ekwan's great journey. He also went on to create other icons of Japanese design. In Japan, Ekwan has become almost as recognizable as his bottle, and 50 years later still appeared in commercials for the soy sauce. Today, the bottle can be found on the tables of homes and restaurants in more than 100 countries. And in 2015, the bottle was even exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Simple but elegant, this is the design made to create a small moment of happiness, without you even knowing it.
