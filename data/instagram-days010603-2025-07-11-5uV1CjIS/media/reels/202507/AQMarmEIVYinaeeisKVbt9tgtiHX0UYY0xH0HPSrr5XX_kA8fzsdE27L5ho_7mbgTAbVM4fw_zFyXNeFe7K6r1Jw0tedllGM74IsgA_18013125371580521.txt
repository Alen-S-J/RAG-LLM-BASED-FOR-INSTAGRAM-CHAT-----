The design of this little tree's car freshener goes way back to 1952 in Watertown, New York, and an unhappy milkman who is complaining to one of his customers about the bad smell of spoiled milk. Lucky for him, he was talking to Julius Salmon, a Jewish comets who'd fled from Nazi Germany and spent time living in the forest of Canada, studying the aroma of alpine trees. After his chance encounter with the milkman, Salmon started to create paper soaked in natural pine oil. A string was also attached to stop people getting the perfume all over their hands. The freshener was originally in the shape of a bucsum pinup girl, but Salmon changed the design to the pine tree we know today. This allowed the cellophane wrapper to be rolled down slowly, so the fragrance would last that little bit longer. As the automotive industry took off, so did little trees, filling the air with classics like black ice, royal pine, vanilla aroma, and of course new car scent. Fragrant and affordable, this is the design that brings you the head of the aroma of a Canadian woodland, whether you're in a milk cart or a taxi cab.
