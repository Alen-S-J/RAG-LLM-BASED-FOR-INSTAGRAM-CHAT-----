The design of this bottle started in Terahot, Indiana in 1915. At the time, Coca-Cola was being sold at soda fountains, or in a glass bottle called the Hachnesa. But this simple, straight-sided bottle was easy to copy, and imitations were flooding the market. The solution? A national contest for a new bottle that would make Coca-Cola stand out. Even if the bottle were broken, or you touched it in the dark. The Ruth Glass Company got to work on their competition entry, looking up the word Coca, in the Encyclopedia, and coming across an illustration for a Coca-Pod. The curvy, rich shape appealed to the team who used it as the basis for their winning design. The first bottles hit the shelves just to your later. With the added touch of the glass being colored, German green, later changed to Georgia green. In honor of the Coca-Cola Company's foam state. Sleek and iconic. This is the design that's flaunted its curves to become the trademark of the most popular drink in the world.
