The design of the modern tennis racket goes back to England in 1874, an a man named Major Walter Clofton Wingfield. Wingfield patented the rules for a game known as Lawn Tennis, standardizing elements like balls, nets, and rackets. For the next century, rackets would be made of wood, and remain similar in shape to Wingfield's original design. But in 1961, French tennis legend Renee Lecoffs unveiled a radical invention. The crocodile, as he was nicknamed, had made a prototype using metal. Just a few years later, Wilson released the T2000, the first stainless steel racket whose futuristic design caught the eye of players like Billie Jean King and Jimmy Connors. Its small head and open throat reduced air resistance and helped Connors win the US Open five times. The 1970s ushered in an era of aluminum, which was lighter and easier to mold than steel. This was followed by fashionable oversized rackets that had a larger sweet spot and gave players more power. Eventually, the quest for lightness and durability led to graphite rackets, as well as other materials like Kevlar and Graffine. Today, Wilson and French brand Babilott dominate both the men's and women's game, with the two brands winning 71% of professional tournaments in 2017. Precisely and powerful, this is the design that helped create legends with every stroke.
