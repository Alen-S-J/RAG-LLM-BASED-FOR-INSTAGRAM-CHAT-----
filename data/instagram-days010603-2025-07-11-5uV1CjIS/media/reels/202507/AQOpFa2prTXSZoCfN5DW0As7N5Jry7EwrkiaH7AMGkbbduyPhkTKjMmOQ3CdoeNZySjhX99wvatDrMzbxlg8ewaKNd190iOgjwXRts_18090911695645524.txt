The design of this shoe starts in Oregon in 1981 and with a man called Tinker Hat Field. He was an architect for Nike, hired to drop offices and showrooms on the company's campus. After making a statement on the outside of the building, he was asked to join the designers on the inside. In a race to develop sneakers, a former NASA engineer had recently introduced the idea of sealing air bubbles in the soles for extra comfort and performance. But competition was fierce and Nike still needed an edge. Hat Field headed to Paris in search of inspiration. While he was there, he visited the Pompadue Center, a radical building famous for its inside out design, which exposed the building's components like escalators and heating pipes for everyone to see. But Field decided to apply the same principle to his own design, revealing the inner workings of the shoe by making the air cushioning system visible. The marketing team thought the air bubble would seem like a weakness, but the Nike Air Max 1 wasn't instant hit when it launched in 1987. Originally, Paris sold for $75. Now they go for double that. Today, Tinker Hat Field is one of the most successful shoe designers in the world. He even created those legendary self-lacing sneakers, a back to the future fame. Stylish and innovative, this is the design that stayed one step ahead, simply by being turned inside out.
