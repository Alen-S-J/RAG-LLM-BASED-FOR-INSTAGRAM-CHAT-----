DeepMind just dropped Genie 3, which is an AI system that's able to build video game worlds in real-time. It's a new AI world model that can generate interactive 3D worlds with just a text prompt. And after it's outputted, users and AI agents can actually fully explore those worlds in real-time. And compared to its predecessors, Genie 3 in particular has a bunch of really key upgrades. Not only can you navigate and interact with these environments in real-time, they've also introduced visual memory so that objects stay where you love them. If you walk away from a canvas and return, the things that you painted on that canvas remain. And there are also promptable world events like adding characters or changing the weather in real-time, or even triggering events by simply typing a prompt. Another big upgrade is that worlds can stay coherent for minutes now, whereas they only last about 10 to 20 seconds in Genie 2. And what I personally think as most technically impressive is that Genie 3 is way more physics-aware. It actually understands how the world should behave, like fire flickering or water-slashing, without requiring any sort of manually coded physics engine. It also supports first-person navigation when you pair of deepbinds agents like SEMA, and you can actually simulate gold-driven behavior like walk to that door or walk to that foreclift. All of this matters because Genie 3 and other world models are actually a really important stepping stone towards AGI. If we want AGI, then we need agents that are able to operate in open-ended, unpredictable environments. And world models like Genie essentially provide virtually unlimited and dynamic training data. And in these world models, agents are going to be able to learn by doing, by planning, reacting, and adapting just like humans would. At the same time, as with most things in AGI, Genie 3 is still far from our end goal. Right now, it can only create a few minutes of consistent simulation, which is far from real-world timescale. And while you can create individual streets or parts of a city, you aren't able to generate faithful replicas of cities like Paris or Tokyo. Another big limitation is that you can only perform very few agent actions right now. Agents are able to move and observe, but they can't yet perform complex tasks or change the world on their own. Right now, Genie 3 is still only in limited research preview for academics and certain creators, but it does offer us a glimpse into what dynamic user-generated worlds could look like.
