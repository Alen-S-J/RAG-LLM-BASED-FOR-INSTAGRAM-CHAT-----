So GPT-5 finally dropped and no we are still not at AGI. But I'm sure you've been seeing all the videos and explainers on your feet about it. Now all those do a great job covering the new features so I'm not going to go too deeply into that. Instead I want to spend a little bit more time talking about the significance of GPT-5 and how the tech ecosystem is reacting to it. First on background it's been officially two years since GPT-4's debut and OpenAi's been very intentional about holding back the GPT-5 release. They wanted it to represent a meaningful jump in capability something that was a true milestone in the road to AGI. And in the last few years they pushed out some okay stuff. They had the Orion project which a lot of people said was kind of underwhelming and then they also launched GPT-4.5 earlier this year in February and it was solid but not a big enough step change in user experience to warrant the GPT-5 name. So with this launch it sounds like OpenAi believes that they've cleared the bar. On the technical front architecturally GPT-5 isn't one model. Instead it's a system of models working together. When you ask a pretty simple query, it'll route you to a lightweight faster model, but if you ask a complex question, it'll automatically trigger deeper reasoning and use more resources. That means that hopefully it's much more cost-efficient and fast, while still being able to deliver higher quality reasoning when you need it. In terms of rollout, GPT-5 is actually going to become the default model for all chat GPT users, including the free tier. That's big because it means that millions of people who have only ever had access to lighter models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are now getting their hands on a reasoning capable model. However, a change you might have noticed and one that I personally miss is that model picker is now gone. This is actually really great if you don't care or know about the differences between the different models. It is frustrating for people who like switching models for different tasks. So given all of this, what are early reactions? There are a lot of positive takes because it's simply more accurate, faster, and makes less obvious mistakes. And pricing noticeably was a big surprise. GPT-5 is going to be priced at $1.25 per million in put tokens, which is a lot cheaper than Clause Opus 4.1, which is priced at $15 per million in put tokens. However, there are still caveats. A lot of people are saying that it very much so still hallucinates, especially without deeper reasoning, and coding wise, even though you have the CEO of cursor saying that it's the best model for coding right now, other developers are saying that they still prefer Clause Opus for code heavy workflows. So all in all, is it better than GPD4? Yes, on accuracy, on hallucinations. Do I see it as a crazy milestone towards AGI? I don't know yet.
