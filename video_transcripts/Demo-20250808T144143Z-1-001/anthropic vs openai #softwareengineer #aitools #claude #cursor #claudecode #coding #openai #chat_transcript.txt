Anthropics just cut off OpenAI's access to its Clawed AI models, accusing them of violating their terms of service. And this is all happening right as GPT-5 is about to drop. It's kind of a dramatic and unusually public fallout between two of the top AI players. OpenAI had essentially been using Anthropics Clawed models specifically its popular Clawed Code tool to benchmark GPT-5. In Anthropics eyes, they said that this crossed the line and that you're not allowed to use Clawed to build or improve a competing product. They saw it as OpenAI trying to reverse engineer or benchmark Clawed in a way that fuels rival development. OpenAI's defense was that this was industry standard. That cross-monopoly valuations are a routine and a really important part of responsible AI development. And they even specifically emphasized that they still allow Clawed access to its own API, implying that this is all a one-sided move by Anthropic. This matters because it's one of the most public and pointed examples of the friction in the AI arms race. We're kind of entering a phase in the AI industry where collaboration is breaking down. A lot of these companies used to share benchmarks. and even research vapors, but now the stakes are simply too high, especially with GPT-5 on the horizon. And I think what this means is that companies will use API access as leverage. In the same way, that Facebook wants restricted vine, or when Salesforce block rivals from Slack's API, we're going to start seeing API gating as more of a competitive mode. And in an industry where there aren't necessarily rules around fair benchmarking yet, there are pretty blurry lines around actual evaluation and building off of a competitor's IP. So for now, it's turning into a little bit of a free-veral. This latest tension is probably one of the clearer signs that the AI model players are no longer playing nice.
