We now have two pretty solid speculative mockups of what OpenAI's AI hardware might look like. The first one coming out of a Wall Street Journal report, and the second one coming from Min Chi Quo, who's an Apple analyst famous for his Apple predictions. Both are predicting that it'll be a small, screenless, wearable AI assistant, much more like an iPod shuffle than an iPhone. And here's what we know or can reasonably guess so far. All in himself has said that the device won't be a phone or glasses, especially since he's hoping that it'll help people ween off of screens. Voice then will probably be the primary mode of interaction. And as we know, Sam Altman is very open about his admiration for the movie, Herr, which is also further emphasized by the Sura-Lit Jo Hansen voice controversy. Quo in particular believes that the device will be warned comfortably around the neck, and that there won't be any sort of display, just a camera and a microphone array to detect the user's environment, and that it'll offload any processing or visuals to your phone or PC. He predicts that it'll become a third core device that's meant to sit alongside your laptop as well as your phone, but meant to blend quietly into your daily life. Regarding the actual launch timeline and manufacturing, mass production. is said to be slated for 2027 and likely in Vietnam as opposed to China due to the geopolitical risk. Their target is to have 100 million plus units shipped and all men believe that it could be the fastest selling consumer device in history. In this sense, the end game here is that you have an AI that you don't ever have to ask. You don't have to learn better ways to prompt chat Gbt. Instead, it's an ambient assistant that just knows you. It sees what you see, it hears what you hear, and proactively helps before you even have to ask.
