Imagine you're having a house party. What's your go to place to Kuala Sto? So I actually end up hosting house parties because I really want people to try this food. My favorite is ITC Master Chef Creations. And what I like ITC is I get to order this really nice Murk Kulcha Dabeli. Oh yes. Or the Chole Kulcha Dabeli for the vegetar rice. It's like a mix between Dabeli and Kulcha. So delicious. I've never found a single person who's not like it. It is a fancy Dabeli but it's a really good fancy Dabeli. My favorite is the Mutton Shikham Kori Kabab. Totally a bangle. Everyone should try it. And if I order one more, I would really recommend the Subs Galati Kabab. It's vegetarian but it gives any non-vegetarian starter or grandfather. That's more sharp. It's very but at least soft. Literally disintegrates in your mouth. Yeah.
