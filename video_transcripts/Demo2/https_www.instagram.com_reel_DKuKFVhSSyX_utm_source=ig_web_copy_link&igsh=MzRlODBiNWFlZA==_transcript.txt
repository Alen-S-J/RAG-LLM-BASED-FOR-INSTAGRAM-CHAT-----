Give me your favorite burger in Bangalore. I will go with the Swiss cheese from Beyond Burgh. Perfectly grilled smashed patty, cheese, caramelized onions, and really soft buns. My current favorite is Okla Homa, smashed burger from Gorilla Diner. It's a smashed patty with very simple ingredients. The Adamlite Loneans, American cheese, some pickles and togg. I'm hungry already. My next favorite is a bit offbeat, which is the Wellington from Smash Guys. It's an old 2D Wellington in the UK. It has a super crisp patty, a very intense meat flavor, mushroom and mustard sauce. It's not a burger I understand, but it's a pastrami sandwich from Beyond Burgh. It literally melts in your mouth. Yeah. Again, very simple ingredients, mustard, pickles. I usually end up not just having a sandwich, but just the meat coming out of here. You can just, yeah, the pastrami has crossed cured so well.
