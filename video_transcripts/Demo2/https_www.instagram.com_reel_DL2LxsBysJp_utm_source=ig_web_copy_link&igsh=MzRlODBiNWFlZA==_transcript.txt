How do men show their care without ever saying it? When we notice you're not okay, we just say, let's go out and eat. Food is the answer to most of the things. We never say I miss you, but we'll randomly text, hey, you alive. Yeah, very nonchalant. We would make fun of you in front of people, but defend you the moment someone else tries to do. We would never ask, how are you? But instead ask, you're good. We will mock your gym form, but we'll spot you like a pro. Because we want you to build that body. We would never let you text your ex after two drinks. Oh yeah, for sure. We will send you memes without saying hi. Yeah, that's our eye.
