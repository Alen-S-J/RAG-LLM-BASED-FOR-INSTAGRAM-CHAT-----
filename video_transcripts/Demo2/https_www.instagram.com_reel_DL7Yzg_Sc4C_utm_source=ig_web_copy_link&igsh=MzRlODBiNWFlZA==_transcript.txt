What are some signs of emotional maturity? When someone is trying to open up to you, you recognize that you can be egoistic, but you know how to calm it down. Yeah, that's true. You know that someone's past could be traumatic for them, so you don't weaponize it in their face. Mmm, that's a big one. You don't punish their vulnerability. You may be listening to understand and not necessarily to respond. That's how you make someone comfortable being vulnerable with you. You don't take everything personally because not everything is about you. Yeah, that's true.
