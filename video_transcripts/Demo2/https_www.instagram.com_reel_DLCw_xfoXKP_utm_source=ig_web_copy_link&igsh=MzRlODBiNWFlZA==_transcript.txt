What is the number one thing to look for in a partner? I think values just is one thing. I know that why not ambition, passion, even looks. You know, when you are with someone for a considerable amount of time, a lot of things about them change every few years. They put on a little weight, their ambition changes, their interests change, they build new passions. So when you are with someone, you essentially are going to fall in love with someone new or them all over again. But if you look for values, I think that's one thing that keeps you away anchored. And you know that even if anything else changes, this is what you seek and this is what you came into this relationship for. And I also believe that in this world of external validation, it's very hard to be just attracted by someone's value.
