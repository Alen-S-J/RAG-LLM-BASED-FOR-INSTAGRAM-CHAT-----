What are some relationship nice behaviors that are actually red flags? Someone who always agrees with you and does not express what they actually want. Constantly giving gifts or doing grand gestures to impress you. Someone being very over-protective of you about everything in your life. Be it career, be it friends, who you're hanging out with. Most of your decisions. Somebody who gives you a sense that you complete me. Which might initially sound very passionate, but it's actually like a warning sign. Someone who always prioritizes you over anything else. That could be a really good thing, but sometimes it also means I am completely overseeing what my needs are. And that gradually brews into something that becomes claustrophrobic. And there is some level of frustration because I never expressed what I really wanted. Like, talking from a life to another. What are you doing?
